So i decided to get with the times.

The times of early 2010 when everyone with access to the internet had a blogg. Am i behind? Or will it be just like with fashion, just wait long enought and you can reuse those ugly jeans again.

Heres something pretty cool, this blog is hosted completly on github! Using only static pages! [See](https://github.com/Wrexthor/swedjemark) for yourself!

No? You didn't find that cool? Oh well, we can't all be nerds...
