          Sales is often seen as dirty, I&#39;m guilty of this as well. But in fact every encounter where you want your own opinion or interest considered is a form of sales pitch. The further you get from a practical, hands-on job, the more you will be selling. All meetings involve selling ideas, perspectives or reasons. Raising a child involves selling your values, your ideals and what to eat for dinner..

          This blog is, for me, an exercise in embracing the suck. While I&#39;m not a perfectionist (since I never really finish anything) I am quite conscious about the quality of what I create.
It would therefore be very easy to write dozens of drafts without ever publishing anything..
